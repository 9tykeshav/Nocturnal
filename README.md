# Nocturnal
A simple fun discord bot i made before learning python , with no knowledge of python 

NOTE - 
• As i mentioned this code is a mess don't take inspiration from it

IMPROVMENTS :- 
• Make uses of cog to avoid mess / big code. i wasn't familiar with classes / OOP that's
 why i didn't used cogs.
• Repetion of code , you may see repetition of code all across the bot , Mess/ useless code , please avoid doing that 
•And the list goes on....

this is the first project i made while learning python...So that's the reason its a mess
(Nocturnal is discountinued i.e no more maintainance)
