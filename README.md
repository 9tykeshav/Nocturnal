# Nocturnal

A Discord bot I built while learning Python. My first real project.

This was me figuring out how to make things work — async programming,
database connections, API calls, the works. It's not pretty, but it
taught me a lot.

## What it does

**Moderation** — Ban, kick, mute, purge messages, lock channels

**Games** — Guess the Brand, Who's That Pokémon, roulette, coin toss

**Social** — Hug, pat, slap, cuddle (with GIFs)

**Utility** — Google search, animal facts, server audit logs, AI chat
via Cleverbot

**Anime** — Character GIFs for Zoro, Naruto, and others

## Tech

- Python + discord.py
- PostgreSQL (asyncpg) for game data and ping tracking
- External APIs: Cleverbot, Google Search, Discord Bot List

## Honest notes

This was before I knew about cogs, proper structure, or how to avoid
copy-pasting code everywhere. If you're learning, don't use this as a
reference for *how* to write a bot — but maybe as proof that you can
build something real while still figuring things out.
